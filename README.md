# Cloud Stock Price Prediction using Python / Streamlit / AWS

This project aims to predict the closing prices of five major tech companies - Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon using long short-term memory (LSTM) models. The data is obtained from Yahoo Finance from 2012 to 2023, and the LSTM models are trained using Keras, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn. The predicted closing prices are then visualized on a web page using Streamlit and displayed with graphs. The proposed system is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for scalability and reliability.
